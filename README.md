JSC64 (read: Javascript Compiler for the (Commodore) 64)
********************************************************

A nonprofessional hobbyists attempt to write a compiler in javascript for the MOS 6502/6510 processor and the Commodore 64.

I am not a professional coder in any way and to be honest I don't really know what I am doing.

<br />

This project fulfills 2 learning goals for me personally:
  1) To take first steps in javascript
  2) To write a small compiler

<br />

I'm more of a C person, Basic person and Pascal person, so I don't have much knowledge about all the neat OOP features of javascript and I think I'm going to program javascript more C style and less the way JS should probably be programmed. So I am using all that stuff like procedures/functions, global variables and more nasty things.

But I have to stand by that, OOP style was never mine and I could never figure out what it was all about. Maybe it's my age, I'm from the C64 era and learned to code like that (as a hobbyist, mind you).

How can you execute JSC64?

Just start "main.html" in a browser, and the rest of it should be pretty self-explanatory.

English is not my native language, I use translation software along with my own not so bad English skills. Nevertheless, I'm afraid some wording may be strange (from time to time).
