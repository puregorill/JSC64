# JSC64

********************************************************
JSC64 (read: Javascript Compiler for the (Commodore) 64)
********************************************************

A nonprofessional hobbyist attempting to write a compiler in Javascript for the NMOS 6502/6510 processor and the Commodore 64.

I am not a professional coder in any way and to be honest I don't really know what I am doing.

Everything here is for personal use and educational purposes only. Everything is absolutely without warranty. 

If something does not work or causes damage, I take no responsibility in any way (see LICENSE).

<br />

This project fulfills 2 learning goals for me personally:
  1) To take first steps in javascript (I just started learning javascript a week before starting this toy compiler project)
  2) To write a small toy compiler

<br />

I'm more of a C person, Basic person and Pascal person, so I don't have much knowledge about all the neat OOP features of Javascript and I think I'm going to program Javascript more C style and less the way JS should probably be programmed. So I am using all that stuff like procedures/functions, global variables and more nasty things.

But I have to stand by that, OOP style was never mine and I could never figure out what it was all about. Maybe it's my age, I'm from the C64 era and learned to code like that (as a hobbyist, mind you).

**************************
How can you execute JSC64?
**************************

Just start <main.html> in a browser, and the rest of it should be pretty self-explanatory.

You can compile the testfile or type something yourself in the left text field.

If you want to run the generated assembly code (it is kind of ACME style), then I recommend to copy and paste it into C64Studio. From there you can build the binary code and run it directly with e.g. the C64 emulator VICE. Both can be found with a few mouse clicks via google.

<br />

C64 Studio is a Commodore development system for Windows on the PC.

VICE ("Versatile Commodore Emulator", for Windows also WinVICE) is a program that can execute programs for Commodore's 8-bit computers, e.g. the C64, the PET, VIC20 and much more.

ACME is a free crossassembler. It supports NMOS 6502 and more processors.

********************
State of development
********************

Very early stage. Currently working on mathematical parser. Not much else implemented yet.

If you have a look at <main.js> and <main.html>, then it should be no issue to trace the structure of the JS program from there.

Codebase not extremely, but still a bit messed up and is certainly subject to future changes and restructuring.

One word of warning
*******************

English is not my native language, I use translation software along with my own not so bad English skills. Nevertheless, I'm afraid some wording may be strange (from time to time).
