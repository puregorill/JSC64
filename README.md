JSC64 (read: Javascript Compiler for the (Commodore) 64)
********************************************************

A nonprofessional hobbyists attempt to write a compiler in javascript for the MOS 6502/6510 processor and the Commodore 64.

I am not a professional coder in any way and to be honest I don't really know what I am doing.

<br />

This project fulfills 2 learning goals for me personally:
  1) To take first steps in javascript
  2) To write a small compiler

<br />

I'm more of a C person, Basic person and Pascal person, so I don't have much knowledge about all the neat OOP features of javascript and I think I'm going to program javascript more C style and less the way JS should probably be programmed. So I am using all that stuff like procedures/functions, global variables and more nasty things.

But I have to stand by that, OOP style was never mine and I could never figure out what it was all about. Maybe it's my age, I'm from the C64 era and learned to code like that (as a hobbyist, mind you).

How can you execute JSC64?
**************************

Just start "main.html" in a browser, and the rest of it should be pretty self-explanatory.

You can compile the testfile or type something yourself in the left text field.

If you want to run the generated assembly code (it is kind of ACME style), then I recommend to copy and paste it into C64Studio. From there you can build the binary code and run it directly with e.g. the C64 emulator VICE. Both can be found with a few mouse clicks via google.

C64 Studio: The C64 Studio is a handy Commodore development system for Windows on the PC, developed by Georg Rottensteiner.

VICE: ("Versatile Commodore Emulator", for Windows also WinVICE) is a program that runs on various platforms and can execute programs for Commodore's 8-bit computers, e.g. the C64, the PET, VIC20 and much more.

********************
State of development
********************

Very early stage. Currently working on mathematical parser. Not much else implemented yet.

If you have a look at main.js and main.html, then it should be no issue to trace the structure of the JS program from there.

One word of warning
*******************

English is not my native language, I use translation software along with my own not so bad English skills. Nevertheless, I'm afraid some wording may be strange (from time to time).
