JSC64 (read: Javascript Compiler for the (Commodore) 64)

A nonprofessional hobbyists attempt to write a compiler in javascript for the MOS 6502/6510 processor and the Commodore 64.

I am not a professional coder in any way and to be honest I don't really know what I am doing.

This project fulfills 2 learning goals for me personally:
  1) To take first steps in javascript
  2) To write a small compiler

I'm more of a C person, Basic person and Pascal person, so I don't have much knowledge about all the neat OOP features of javascript and I think I'm going to program javascript more C style and less the way JS should probably be programmed. 
But I have to stand by that, OOP style was never mine and I could never figure out what it was all about. Maybe it's my age, I'm from the C64 era and learned to program like that (as a hobbyist, mind you).
