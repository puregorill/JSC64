A nonprofessional hobbyist attempting to write a compiler in Javascript for the NMOS 6502/6510 processor and the Commodore 64.

I am not a professional coder in any way and to be honest I don't really know what I am doing.

Everything here is for personal use and educational purposes only. Everything is absolutely without warranty. 

If something does not work or causes damage, I take no responsibility in any way (see LICENSE).

<br />

This project fulfills 2 learning goals for me personally:
  1) To take first steps in javascript (I just started learning javascript a week before starting this toy compiler project)
  2) To develop a small toy compiler

<br />

I'm more of a C person, Basic person and Pascal person, so I don't have much knowledge about all the neat OOP features of Javascript and I think I'm going to program Javascript more C style and less the way JS should probably be programmed. So I am using all that stuff like procedures/functions, global variables and more nasty things.

But I have to stand by that, OOP style was never mine and I could never figure out what it was all about. Maybe it's my age, I'm from the C64 era and learned to code like that (as a hobbyist, mind you).

********************
State of development
********************

Very early stage. Currently working on mathematical parser. Not much else implemented yet. 

See: https://github.com/puregorill/JSC64/wiki/1.-Quick-start-tutorial,-development-log

If you have a look at <main.js> and <main.html>, then it should be no issue to trace the structure of the JS program from there.

Codebase not extremely, but still a bit messed up and is certainly subject to future changes and restructuring.

One word of warning

English is not my native language, I use translation software along with my own not so bad English skills. Nevertheless, I'm afraid some wording may be strange (from time to time).
